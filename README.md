# Big Two Card Game

The project is an entension from an Object-Oriented Programming assignment.

The project is developed in Eclipse IDE for Java Developers. The .settings folders, .classpath and .project files are maintained by Eclipse, and guarantees the protability of the program. Feel free to download the program to plat Big Two Card Game!

Part of the project classes, which I extended to other classes, are developed by Dr. Kenneth Wong, University of Hong Kong.

*Enjoy the game!!!*
